# Express with Typescript Demo

## Overview
Small demo showing what express with typescript looks like made following [Brad Traversy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRo2tvQpus8). Alternatively, you could implement something like [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) but this does away with the need for the overhead that it would come with. 

This demo assumes that [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) is installed `globally` which will give you access to `tsc`/typescript compiler.
